# About Game
Skull King is a trick-taking game in which you will bid
the exact number of tricks you predict you will win each
round. You’ll battle with your rivals as you strive to keep
your own bid afloat… while seizing opportunities to also
sink your opponents! The pirate with the highest score at
the end of the game wins and earns the title of Captain of
the Seven Seas!
