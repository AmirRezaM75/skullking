A standard suit out of suit loses no matter how high your number is 
if you play black suit it trumps standard suit regardless of its value


# Rules

If a suit card is played first in a trick (lead), all players must
‘follow suit’ and play that same suit (if they are going to
play a numbered card). If you don’t have the suit that was
lead, you may play any other suit.

Special cards allow you to break the rules governing
numbered cards

In the rare event that each player plays
an escape card, Tigress as an escape, or a loot card, in the
same trick; the first card played wins the trick.


If a Pirate, the Skull King, and a Mermaid are all played in the same trick,
the Mermaid always wins the trick, regardless of order of play.
Only the Mermaid capturing the Skull King bonus is earned.


When you lead a trick, you may choose to play either a suit
card or a special card.

## When a special card is led

### Leading with an escape
When an Escape is lead, the next player sets the suit that must be followed,
unless they play one of these as well, which would defer setting the suit
to the next player.

### Leading with a character

When a Mermaid, Pirate, Skull King, Kraken, or White Whale
leads a trick, there is no suit to follow for that trick.
Each other player may play any card they choose.
